  <h1>Daniel's Eloquent Javascript</h1>

  <h2>Chapter 1</h2>

  <blockquote>...without care, a program’s size and complexity will grow out of control, confusing even the person who created it. Keeping programs under control is the main problem of programming. When a program works, it is beautiful. The art of programming is the skill of controlling complexity. The great program is subdued—made simple in its complexity.</blockquote>

  <p>

  Chapter one describes each data type in the language, the various operators we can use on them, and the many idiosyncrasies of javascript ( does NaN == NaN? Of course not...). There aren't any exercises for this chapter.

  </p>

  <h2>Chapter 2: program_structure</h2>

  <h4>Looping a triangle</h4>

  <p>Write a loop that makes seven calls to console.log to output the following triangle:</p>
<p>#</p>
<p>##</p>
<p>###</p>
<p>####</p>
<p>#####</p>
<p>######</p>
<p>#######</p>

  </p>

  <pre><code>
let hashtags = "";

for (var i=0; i<7; i++)
  console.log(hashtags+="#");
  </code></pre>

  <h4>FizzBuzz</h4>

  <p>Write a program that uses console.log to print all the numbers from 1 to 100, with two exceptions. For numbers divisible by 3, print "Fizz" instead of the number, and for numbers divisible by 5 (and not 3), print "Buzz" instead.</p>

	<p>When you have that working, modify your program to print "FizzBuzz", for numbers that are divisible by both 3 and 5 (and still print "Fizz" or "Buzz" for numbers divisible by only one of those).</p>

	<pre><code>
		
for(let i=1; i<=100; i++){

  if (i%3===0 && i%5===0)
    console.log("FizzBuzz")
  else if(i%3===0)
    console.log("Fizz")
  else if(i%5===0)
    console.log("Buzz");
  else
    console.log(i);

}

	</code></pre>

	<p>I also solved the FizzBuzz problem using recursion and pushing each value into an array.</p>

	<pre><code>
		
let FizzBuzzArray = [];

function fizzBuzz(n){

  if(n>=101){
    console.log(FizzBuzzArray)
    return;
  }
    
  if (n%3===0 && n%5===0)
    FizzBuzzArray.push("FizzBuzz");
  else if(n%3===0)
    FizzBuzzArray.push("Fizz")
  else if(n%5===0)
    FizzBuzzArray.push("Buzz");
  else
    FizzBuzzArray.push(n);
  
  fizzBuzz(n+1);
}

fizzBuzz(1);

	</code></pre>


<h4>Chess Board</h4>

<p>Write a program that creates a string that represents an 8×8 grid, using newline characters to separate lines. At each position of the grid there is either a space or a “#” character. The characters should form a chess board.</p>
	
<pre>
		
let gridLength;
let grid = [];

///first function creates the entire grid with the spaces and hashtags
function gridMaker(n){
  
    gridLength = n*n;
    
    for(var i=0;i&#60;gridLength; i++){
      
      if (i%2===0){
        
        grid.push('#')
        
      }else{
        
        grid.push(' ');
        
      }
      
      
    }
    
    gridDivider(n, grid);
  
}

gridMaker(8);

///second function divides the grid into lines
function gridDivider(n, grid){
  
  let newLine;
  
  for(let i=0;i&#60;n;i++){
    
    //account for even number bug
    if (n%2===0 && i%2===0){

      newLine = grid.splice(0,n);
      console.log(newLine.reverse());
      
    }else{
  
      newLine = grid.splice(0,n);
      console.log(newLine);
    }
  }
  
}

</pre>

<h4>Chapter 3: functions</h4>

<p>In short, each local scope can also see all the local scopes that contain it. The set of variables visible inside a function is determined by the place of that function in the program text. All variables from blocks around a function’s definition are visible—meaning both those in function bodies that enclose it and those at the top level of the program. This approach to variable visibility is called lexical scoping.</p>

<p>People who have experience with other programming languages might expect that any block of code between braces produces a new local environment. But in JavaScript, functions are the only things that create a new scope. You are allowed to use free-standing blocks.</p>

<p>My notes: In ES6 this is slightly different. A replacement for var called let is introduced. Variables declared with let have local scope in places such as if statements as well as functions.</p>

<p>...function declarations are not part of the regular top-to-bottom flow of control. They are conceptually moved to the top of their scope and can be used by all the code in that scope. This is sometimes useful because it gives us the freedom to order code in a way that seems meaningful, without worrying about having to define all functions above their first use.
</p>

<p>A pure function is a specific kind of value-producing function that not only has no side effects but also doesn’t rely on side effects from other code—for example, it doesn’t read global variables that are occasionally changed by other code. A pure function has the pleasant property that, when called with the same arguments, it always produces the same value (and doesn’t do anything else).</p>

<h4>Ch 3 Exercises</h4>
<p><strong>Minimum</strong></p>
<p>Write a function min that takes two arguments and returns their minimum.</p>

<pre>
	
function min(a,b){

	if (a&#60;=b){
    
      return a;
    
    }else{
      return b;
    }
  
}

</pre>

<p>Solved using a ternary as well:</p>

<pre>
	
function min(a,b){

	a<=b ? a: b;
  
}

</pre>

<p><strong>Recursion</strong></p>

<p>We’ve seen that % (the remainder operator) can be used to test whether a number is even or odd by using % 2 to check whether it’s divisible by two. Here’s another way to define whether a positive whole number is even or odd:

 Zero is even.

 One is odd.

 For any other number N, its evenness is the same as N - 2.

Define a recursive function isEven corresponding to this description. The function should accept a number parameter and return a Boolean.

Test it on 50 and 75. See how it behaves on -1. Why? Can you think of a way to fix this?</p>

<pre>
	
function isEvenRecursion(n){
  
  //every number positive and negative becomes positive when multiplied by itself
  if(n&#60;0){
    n*=n;
  }
  
  if(n===0){
    return true;
  }else if(n===1){
    return false;
  }else{
    return isEvenRecursion(n-2);
  }
  
}

</pre>

<p><strong>Bean Counting</strong></p>

<p>Write a function countBs that takes a string as its only argument and returns a number that indicates how many uppercase “B” characters are in the string.</p>

<pre>
	
function countBs(string){
  
  let count=0;
  
    for (let i=0; in&#60;string.length; i++){
      
      if(string.charAt(i)==='B'){
        
          count++;
        
      }
      
    }
    return count;
  
}

</pre>

<p>Next, write a function called countChar that behaves like countBs, except it takes a second argument that indicates the character that is to be counted (rather than counting only uppercase “B” characters).</p>

<pre>
	
function charCount(string, char){
  
  let count=0;
  
    for (let i=0; i&#60;string.length; i++){
      
      if(string.charAt(i)===char){
        
          count++;
        
      }
      
    }
    return count;
  
}

</pre>

<h4>Ch 4 Exercises</h4>

<h3>The sum of a range</h3>

<p>Write a range function that takes two arguments, start and end, and returns an array containing all the numbers from start up to (and including) end.</p>

<p>Next, write a sum function that takes an array of numbers and returns the sum of these numbers. Run the previous program and see whether it does indeed return 55.</p>

<p>As a bonus assignment, modify your range function to take an optional third argument that indicates the “step” value used to build up the array. If no step is given, the array elements go up by increments of one, corresponding to the old behavior. The function call range(1, 10, 2) should return [1, 3, 5, 7, 9]. Make sure it also works with negative step values so that range(5, 2, -1) produces [5, 4, 3, 2].</p>

<pre>
	
function range(a,b,c){
  
  var values = [];
  
  for (var i = a; i<=b; i+=c){
    
    values.push(i);
    
  }
  
  return values;
  
}

function sum(range){
  
  var total = 0;
  
  range.forEach(a => total+=a);
  
  return total;
  
}

console.log(sum(range(2,14,5)));

///I also solved it using the reduce method which is a bit more elegant in this situation

function sumReduce(range){
  
  return range.reduce((a,b) => a+b)
  
}

console.log(sumReduce(range(2,14,5)));
